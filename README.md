# Personal Website Project

## Objective

Develop a personal website that reflects your individuality and goals. The website can serve any purpose (portfolio, blog, information hub, etc.), and should demonstrate professionalism, accessibility, and responsive design.

## Overview

- **Project Duration:** February 14 - May 5
- **Deliverables:** Incremental updates to your personal website, documentation of design and development, and integration of feedback.  
- **Repository:** Your project repository can be hosted on any GitHub account (personal or course organization) but the access to the repository needs to be given to the instructor and the repository link needs to be included in all reports.

## Project Learning Outcomes

- Apply effective design principles.  
- Ensure accessibility and consideration of intercultural perspective.  
- Practice responsive web design to accommodate various devices and screen sizes.  

### Connection to Course and Distribution Learning Outcomes

The project learning outcomes apply to all course and distribution learning outcomes reproduced below.

- **Course Learning Outcomes:**

  - Evaluate and implement web accessibility measures consistent with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) version 2 specification.
  - Design front-end user experiences using accepted web design patterns, methods, and information structures.
  - Identify and use strategies of successful visual rhetoric for the web.

- **Distribution Learning Outcomes:**

## Baseline Requirements

- Implement the design principles (clear layout, intuitive navigation, consistent color scheme, and typography).
- Ensure accessibility (WCAG compliance), consideration of intercultural perspective, and responsive web design.
